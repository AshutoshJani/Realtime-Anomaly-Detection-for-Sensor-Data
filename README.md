### The folders and files are explained as such:
- **artifacts:** folder for storing software package, library, zip file, or any other type of file used for deploying applications (currently empty).
- **Charts&Graphs:** folder to store all the _.png_ and _.jpg_ files of graphs needed for the dissertation.
- **Datasets:** folder to house all the datasets for the project. Due to NDA and size limitations this folder is not pushed to github, but the code expects a folder to be present with this name that houses all the datasets. 
- **ResouurceUtil:** folder to store all _.png_ and _.jpg_ files of screenshots of the resources used by the models as needed for the dissertation.
- **.gitignore:** standard gitignore for python for files to skip and not upload
- **.python-version:** _python 3.11.8_ was used throughout this project.
- **dmg_1.ipynb:** this is the main jupyter notebook that has most of the code related to pre-processing, and building and training the models.
- **explore.ipynb:** this is the jupyter notebook that was used for the exploratory data analysis.
- **gantt_chart.ipynb:** this jupyter notebook was used to create a gantt chart for the project plan that lists the milestones along with timelines that I planned to hit in the duration of the summer project.
- **requirements.txt:** requirements file that has the necessary libraries and version as used by me.
- **test_pyspark.py:** python script used by me to test the functioning of PySpark.
